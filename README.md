# sheets

Not a reference to bed sheets, but rather a collection of sheet music /
tablature that I have written or learned through my journey of music.

## background

I have been playing music since I was 8 when my grandmother signed me up for
piano lessens. Like most children, I would have given up a year in, but now
am grateful that I stuck with it. As of the summer of 2009, I have been
learning the acoustic guitar sparingly. Now that I have moved and had to leave
my keyboard behind, the music I play is mainly for the acoustic guitar.

## contributions

The purpose of this repo is not only to keep a record of what I play, but also
to get feedback from the vast community. I am looking mainly for alterations to
existing music, but always welcome a new song or two.

Please note that before publishing to the master branch, I will attempt to play
the song and then post to the repo if it is ready. If you do not like what I
deem as "ready", then feel free to fork the repo and host the fork. Nothing
wrong there.

## future

I would not mind there being a way to let a user know the difficulty of the
song. Also, it would be nice to let the user know what instrument is used for
the sheet / tablature.
